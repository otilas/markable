# Markable

Do your users want to add food, drinks, books, movies, and many
other stuff to favorites?

_— How should I name this table — users_foods or foods_users?_<br/>
_— Damn, I forget to add ```:id => false``` to migration again!_<br/>
_— Holy sh*t! I have to create a lot of tables for this relations!_

Nope, you don't have to create relations or think about migrations — **markable** will handle this.

Should your users be able to add each other to friends? Or do you want to
make a twitter-like followers system?

_— Oh… Self-relation again…_

Nope, **markable** can handle it too!



##Installation

Add to your Gemfile

```
gem 'markable', github: 'qx/markable'

```
### merge bug fix
> Properly generate migration file, let Rails 4 apps use the gem
> add .rb extension to migration filename


Run

```
bundle install
rails generate markable:migration
rake db:migrate
```

##Upgrade

If you are upgrading from version 0.1.0 or less, run
```
rake markable:delete_orphan_marks
```

## Usage

At first you should define markers — these are models which will mark
other models.

If User can mark Food as favorite, then User — is a marker.

``` ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_marker
end
```

Then you should define markables

``` ruby
class Food < ActiveRecord::Base
  markable_as :favorite
end
```

Thats it! Now you can mark pizza as a favorite food of your user

``` ruby
user.set_mark :favorite, pizza
# or
user.mark_as_favorite pizza
# or
user.favorite_foods << pizza
```

_— Also I hate broccoli!_

As you wish! Just a little change to your Food model

``` ruby
class Food < ActiveRecord::Base
  markable_as [ :hated, :favorite ]
  # or
  markable_as :hated, :favorite
end
```

and The World will know, what kind of food do you hate.

``` ruby
user.hated_foods << broccoli
```

You can easily get list of all food marked as favorite by your user

``` ruby
user.foods_marked_as :favorite
# or
user.foods_marked_as_favorite
# or
user.favorite_foods
```

Also you can get a list of all users, who loves pizza too!

``` ruby
pizza.users_have_marked_as :favorite
# or
pizza.users_have_marked_as_favorite
```

And all food loved by users

``` ruby
Food.marked_as :favorite
# or
Food.marked_as_favorite
```

_— Hmm… What kind of food my friends likes?_

``` ruby
Food.marked_as_favorite :by => [ user1, user2, user3 ]
```

_— Hey! I have found a users who loves pizza too — I want to be friends with them!_

No problem! Just make User markable as friendly!

``` ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_marker
  markable_as :friendly, :by => :user
end
```

And now you can add all pizza-lovers to your friends

``` ruby
user.friendly_users << pizza.users_have_marked_as_favorite
```

Piece of cake!
